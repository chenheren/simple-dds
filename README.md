# What it is simple_dds?
a simple dds, just like a simple FastDDS.

# Why I develop simple_dds?
-  I would like to develop a project independently, Because I can't practice my ideas by writing code in my current company, I think the design of the leader is terrible.
-  I think FastDDS is a good project, and I'm interested in implementing it. So I wanted to understand it with a simple project.

# How I develop simple_dds ?
-  I develop in my spare time.
-  I mainly refer to DDS-1.4 and RTPS-2.5 protocol.
